# Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) beginner tutorials in Typescript

## Jupyter Notebook

Typescript and Jupyter Notebook? Yes! With [tslab](https://github.com/yunabe/tslab)!

## Instructions

> Just download the repo and read the tutorial `.ipynb` files!
> Notes:

    These tutorials are made with Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency in mind, but not too much. The ubiquity of ECC means that these tutorials must also be applicable to other cryptocurrencies.
    These tutorials only cover working with ECC in general. Things specific to the ed25519 curve (the curve used here) like elliptic curve description, cofactor consideration, etc. are not included.
    For educational purposes only!
